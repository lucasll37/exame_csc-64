## Project Overview
This project is a parallelized C application designed to optimize runtime by leveraging OpenMP and hash tables for data processing. The goal is to process records from two data files, apply filters, and combine results to generate output efficiently.

### Features
- Parallelized data processing with OpenMP
- Use of hash tables for fast data lookup (via uthash library)
- Dynamic memory allocation
- Comprehensive error handling

```

### Requirements
- C Compiler (GCC recommended)
- OpenMP library

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lucasll37/exame_csc-64.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd exame_csc-64
   ```

### Usage
To generate synthetic data:
```bash
make db
```

To compiler and run the parallel program:
```bash
make par
```

To compiler and run the sequential program:
```bash
make seq
```
Obs.: To perform fact-time processing, simulate for NUM_RECORDS values ​​up to 50.

### Output
The processed output is saved in the `output` directory as `output_*.csv` and `sorted_output_*.csv` for the ordered version.

### Cleaning Up
To clean up the build and output files:
```bash
make clean
```
